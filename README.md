## Description

This application allows the user to easily add and update a team profile page from the command line. It uses node.js, JavaScript, and the Iquirer and Jest npm packages to dynamically render team information based on specific roles. Styles are created using CSS and Bulma.
 
## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS and Bulma
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* NPM "Inquirer"
* NPM "Jest"

## Functionality

This application uses Node.js, 'Jest' npm, and the 'Inquirer' npm to create a team profile html page by inputing information in the command line. When the application is initialized, the user is asked the name of the team member they are adding. The user then selects a role (manager, engineer, or intern) and is presented with a set of questions. The manager, engineer, and intern classes all have an additional question that is specific to that role. Once the user is finished inputting information about a team member, the application terminates and creates an HTML page in the 'index.html'.

#### The example Team Profile was generated using the Team Profile Generator application I built. The HTML file represented in these screentshots is located in the "index.html".
